# Solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems

Project Euler is a website created in 2001 that hosts over 700 problems that get progressively harder.

I started initially solving these problems because of FreeCodeCamp's [ProjectEuler100](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) challenge

- ProjectEuler100 website: <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/>
- Project Euler website: <https://projecteuler.net/about>

All the solutions are done in **C++** with the _Visual Studio_ IDE.
